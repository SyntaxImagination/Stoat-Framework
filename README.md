# Stoat-Framework
A Slim NodeJS framework designed with focus on minimal usage of packages and maximum functionalities.
The idea behind this project from the trying to increase Native dependencies and reduce the culture of having npm packages for everything `(People tend to depend on plugins for almost everything)`, forgetting that same plugin is just an extension of you everyday node.

We are big fans of **yarn** and **npm**, but we have the culture of asking why before adding anything to our applications and this has always guarantee cleaner, less over-headed applications.

The structure of this project is borrowed from our experience from the **MVC** world and we also tried to take cues from PHP's **CodeIgniter** and **Flight** whose simple struture make them super easy to learn and build on.

Hopefully this project will help developers build more culture of learning node at its core and also contribute to improve the framework.
